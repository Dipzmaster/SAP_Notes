#ABAP UNIT TEST Basics

#TEST UNIT:- 
It can be a class/method, a report program or function module/function pool or module pool. 
These can be put into a test class and test method(s).

Individual test units can be tested by calling them  from either 
SE80, 
class builder(SE24), 
ABAP Editor(SE38) or from 
Function Builder(SE37).

The expectation from the ABAP UNIT Test, is to check whether a unit returns the desired result or not. 
The checking is performed by the service class CL_AUNIT_ASSERT by comparing  expected value & the actual value calculated by a Unit. 

Also in the system the service class CL_ABAP_UNIT_ASSERT is present  but the service class CL_AUNIT_ASSERT is superior than the CL_ABAP_UNIT_ASSERT.

For the test class, 
the RISK LEVEL(Harmless, Dangerous, Critical) and 
DURATION( Short, Medium, Long ) are mandatory additional annotations are added . 
This is because in Transaction- SAUNIT_CLIENT_SETUP a client wide setup for the risk level and 
the duration is mentioned and when testing, the system checks the current test unit risk level and 
duration against the client wide setup.
